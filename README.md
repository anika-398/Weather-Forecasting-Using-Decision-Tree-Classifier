# Weather-Forecasting-Using-Decision-Tree-Classifier
Machine Learning and Exploratory Analysis

#Description:
•	Develop a weather forecasting model using a Decision Tree Classifier.
•	Predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data.
•	Analyze and utilize temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric pressure for real-time decision-making.
•	Aid various sectors like agriculture, aviation, and event planning in making informed decisions.
•	Perform data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
•	Apply hyperparameter tuning on the model to avoid overfitting.
•	Focus on achieving high accuracy and reliability in predicting rain.
•	Finally, associating the model with a website.
##	Tools and Technologies Used:
1.	Environment: Google Colab
2.	Dataset Source: Kaggle
       ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package )
3.	Programming Language: Python
4.	Framework: Flask
5.	Libraries: We have used various libraries to build the model. Such as-
•	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
•	NumPy: For numerical computations
•	Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, including the Decision Tree Classifier
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization
•	Pickle: For converting a Python object into a byte stream to store it in a file
